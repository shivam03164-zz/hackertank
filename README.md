## CraftAR - Android Augmented Reality SDK examples

### Introduction

CraftAR allows to create recognition only and Augmented Reality (AR)
experiences using the CraftAR Service and its Mobile SDK ('Mobile SDK').

With CraftAR, you can create amazing apps that provide digital content
for real-life objects like printed media, packaging among others. You
can use our online web panel or APIs, to upload images to be recognized and set
AR content to display upon recognition in your CraftAR-powered
app.

This document describes mainly the Examples of different uses of the Service and the SDK.
General use of the SDK can be found in the [Documentation section of Catchoom's website](http://catchoom.com/documentation/sdk/android/). Complete SDK documentation of the
classes can be found within the SDK distribution.
